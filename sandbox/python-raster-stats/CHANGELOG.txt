0.6.2
- fix bug in percentiles where feature covers only nodata values
- pep8 cleanup

0.6.1
- Use GetNextFeature to iterate over OGR layers

0.6
- Added a `percentile_q` statistic to calculate the qth percentile for each feature.
- Removed undocumented rasterstats script (may be replaced with more robust CLI tool by 1.0)
- Optional support for outputing "mini-rasters": the clipped, masked numpy array for each feature. (thanks to @ozak again!)
- Support for dynamically adding third-party stats functions - which take a masked array and return a scalar value. (thanks to @ozak)
- Additional examples and ipython notebooks in docs

0.5
- new method for clipping to raster extents, changes bbox_to_pixel_offsets to fix src_array edge cases (thanks @allhailwesttexas and @timcera)

0.4
- Added examples directory with ipython notebooks
- proper pip requirements files
- Deprecated `raster_stats` in favor of `zonal_stats`
- Support for GeoJSON-like FeatureCollections (any things that implements FeatureCollections in the __geo_interface__)
- Support for in-memory numpy arrays and geopandas dataframes

0.3.5
- Add optional "all_touched" rasterization strategy whereby all pixels that touch a geometry are considered (thanks @ozak)

0.3.4
- Gaurd against touching (but not overlapping) polygons. Fixes #27... thanks @engelmannjens

0.3.3
- Create in-memory layer with proper spatial reference object
- don't call ogr.UseExceptions unless needed
